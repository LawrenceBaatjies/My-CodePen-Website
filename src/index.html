			<header>Docker Templates</header>
			<article><p>Docker is a powerful containerization technology that allows the user to start multiple instances of a template and use them as isolated environments that can be destroyed and restarted in a matter of seconds.A full virtual machine usually requires more computer resources (RAM, CPU time and storage), long installation and configuration times and maintenance.The purpose of Parrot for Docker is to easily offer the whole Parrot toolkit on top of every operating system supported by Docker (*NIX distributions, Mac OS and Windows) without all the negative effects of a full virtualized environment.You can fire up a Parrot container inside your existing system or using a cloud provider in just few seconds, and by using an extremely limited amount of resources (just the memory required by the individual tools you run).If you want to perform more tests, each in an isolated environment/workspace, you can start multiple instances from the same Parrot template.</p></article>
